## About The Project

My Notes App is my first big project and important for me. In the project I used the acquired knowledge and put it together in this project.

Using My Notes App, we can easily add and quickly edit/delete our notes.

We set up our own account so that our notes are always available to us.

The application is fully responsive so we can use it on a phone or laptop.
